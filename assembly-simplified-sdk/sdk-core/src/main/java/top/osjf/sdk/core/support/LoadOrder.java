/**
 * This annotation is used to mark the classes that need to be loaded in a specific order.
 *
 * <p>It is typically used to control the loading order of service providers or any components
 * that need to be initialized in a specific order at program startup.
 *
 * <p>By defining an integer type {@code value} attribute, the loading priority of each class
 * can be explicitly specified, where a smaller value indicates a higher loading priority.
 *
 * <p>If {@code value} is not explicitly specified, 'Integer' is used by default MAX_VALUE`ï¼Œ
 * This indicates that the loading priority of this class is the lowest.
 *
 * <p> <b>Purpose:</b>
 * When loading service providers using {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}, the loading order
 * can be determined based on the value of this annotation by combining reflection and custom
 * class loading logic.
 *
 * <p>In custom class loaders or initialization frameworks, such annotations can be read to
 * control the loading and initialization order of classes.
 *
 * <p>In complex systems that require managing the lifecycle order of multiple components,
 * {@link LoadOrder} provides a declarative way to specify the loading order.
 *
 * <p><b>Attention:</b>
 * When using this annotation, please ensure that your application or framework can recognize
 * and process it so that it can correctly apply its specified loading order when loading classes.
 *
 * <p> If there is no custom class loading logic or initialization framework to support this annotation,
 * it will have no effect.
 *
 * <p>In complex systems, in addition to the loading order of classes, other factors such as dependencies
 * and concurrent loading need to be considered to ensure system stability and performance.
