/**
 * Definition of the response interface, which extends from the error response
 * interface and the serializable interface.
 * It is mainly used to encapsulate common attributes of request responses, including
 * whether the request was successful and the response message.
 * By implementing this interface, all response objects can ensure these basic
 * functionalities.
 * <p>
 * This interface requires the implementation of the following functionalities:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #isSuccess()}:determine whether the request was successful,
 *     returning a boolean value.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getMessage()}:obtain the response message, returning a string.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It is mainly used to receive the return value information of the API,
 * defining the method {@link #isSuccess()} to determine whether the request
 * is successful, including the method of obtaining the response message
 * {@link #getMessage()}, other transformation methods and processing methods,
 * defined in {@link Client}.
 *
 * <p>After the request, the corresponding response body will be transformed
 * according to the rewritten {@link PreProcessingResponseHandler} and
 * {@link ResponseConvert}.</p>
